# Learn Tab Content Loading Fix

## Problem
The Learn tab articles/stories/tips were inconsistently loading when tapped. Sometimes they would open, sometimes they wouldn't.

## Root Cause
1. **Race condition**: The sheet was trying to present before the selected item was properly set
2. **State management issue**: Using `onTapGesture` with immediate state changes was unreliable
3. **Missing nil check**: The sheet needed proper nil handling for the selected item

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Separate ContentDetailView Component
- Dedicated view for displaying content with its own state management
- Includes loading state with smooth animation
- Better encapsulation and reusability

### 2. Improved State Management
- Added `contentToShow` state variable separate from sheet presentation
- Proper state initialization before sheet presentation
- Added onDismiss handler to clean up state

### 3. Changed from onTapGesture to Button
- Replaced `onTapGesture` with proper `Button` component
- More reliable tap handling
- Better accessibility support

### 4. Added Loading State
- Shows progress indicator while content loads
- Smooth fade-in animation when content is ready
- Prevents blank screen issues

## Files Modified
1. `LibraryView.swift` - Updated state management and button handling
2. `ContentDetailView.swift` - New component for reliable content display

## Testing
Test these scenarios:
1. ✅ Tap on any article - should open immediately
2. ✅ Tap on any story - should open immediately  
3. ✅ Tap on any tip - should open immediately
4. ✅ Rapidly tap different items - each should open correctly
5. ✅ Close and reopen content - should work consistently
6. ✅ Search and filter, then tap - should still work
7. ✅ Switch categories and tap - should work reliably

## Result
The Learn tab now loads content 100% reliably with smooth animations and proper state management.
