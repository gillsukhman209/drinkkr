# Onboarding Selection Bugs - Fixed ✅

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Slide 13+ Selection Bug** 
**Problem**: Could not select any options from slide 13 (basics questions) onwards.

**Root Cause**: The `OnboardingDataQuestionView` was creating NEW `OnboardingOption` instances every time the view rendered. These new instances had different UUIDs than the ones stored in the viewModel, so equality checks failed.

**Solution**: 
- Created static option arrays in `OnboardingModels.swift` for all data questions
- Updated `OnboardingDataQuestionView` to use these static references
- Now all options have consistent UUIDs throughout the app lifecycle

### 2. **Next Button Greying Out Bug**
**Problem**: When selecting an option, the next button would grey out unexpectedly.

**Root Cause**: The validation setup in `OnboardingViewModel` was incomplete. It was only monitoring some selection variables, not all of them. When certain selections changed, the validation wouldn't update properly.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote `setupValidation()` to monitor ALL selection variables individually
- Each selection now properly triggers `updateCanProceed()`
- Validation state updates immediately and correctly

### 3. **Back Button Position**
**Problem**: Back button was in upper right corner instead of upper left.

**Solution**: 
- Moved back button to upper left corner in progress bar
- Added layout balance for better visual appearance

## Technical Changes Made

### OnboardingModels.swift
Added static option arrays for all data collection questions:
- `ageOptions`
- `genderOptions` 
- `relationshipOptions`
- `drinkingFrequencyOptions`
- `drinksPerSessionOptions`
- `preferredDrinkOptions`
- `weeklySpendingOptions`
- `hoursLostOptions`

### OnboardingViewModel.swift
Rewrote validation setup to properly monitor all fields:
```swift
// Now monitors every single selection variable
$selectedAge.sink { [weak self] _ in self?.updateCanProceed() }
$selectedGender.sink { [weak self] _ in self?.updateCanProceed() }
// ... and all others
```

### OnboardingDataQuestionView.swift
Updated to use static options:
```swift
// Before: Creating new instances
options: [
    OnboardingOption(text: "18-24", icon: nil, color: nil),
    // ...
]

// After: Using static references
options: OnboardingQuestions.ageOptions
```
